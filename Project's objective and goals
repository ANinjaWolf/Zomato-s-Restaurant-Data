Project's Objective and Goals
The objective of this project is to analyze restaurant sales performance by location and cuisine to identify top and bottom performing areas and support strategic business decisions. The goal is to uncover geographical and cuisine-based trends that can inform resource
allocation, marketing efforts, and expansion opportunities. Key findings highlight Tirupati as the highest revenue-generating location with $3.2 million in sales, where pizza stands out as the best-performing cuisnine, contributing $1.49 million. In contrast, Vastrapur,
Ahmedabad ranks lowest in sales with $32,888, and Nandanam also shows poor performance with $49,000. At the brand level, Domino's Pizza leads all restaurants with $5.2 million in total sales. This analysis provides a clear picture of where restaurants are thriving and where
performance improvement strategies are needed.
