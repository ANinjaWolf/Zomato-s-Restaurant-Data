Conclusions
The sales analysis reveals significant performance differences across locations. Tirupati leads all regions with over $3.2 million in revenue, largely driven by the strong performance of pizza, particularly Domino's Pizza, which tops overall restaurant sales at
$5.2 million. In contrast, Vastrapur, Ahmedabad and Nandanam show the lowest sales, with $32,888 and $49,000 respectively. These findings highlight key areas of strength and underperformance, providing a foundation for targeted marketing, operational adjectments, and 
strategic resource allocation to optimize overall business performance.
